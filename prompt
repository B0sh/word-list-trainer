Create and implement a simple next js app like the above.
The app is supposed to be a word list memorization helper called "Walden's Word Trainer"

It should let you make accounts with Better Auth, and when you log in you can create a word list. Use prisma and sqlite for the ORM. To keep it simple, word lists are public for all users.
Then you can study a word list. It should give you a text box to type in a word. Then when you hit enter it should submit the word. If its in the list that's a success, otherwise failure.
When you are done hit done button, and it will show you in two sections, 1. the words you didn't remember. And 2. The words you got incorrect.


Before you get started ask clairfying questions　and create a spec file
